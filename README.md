# Description
Project idea was to create a tool that monitors embedded devices that use linux as the operational system. 
The goal was to check embedded linux board's status by checking different parameters like serial and ssh connection, 
what docker containers are active, environmental variables and checking if desired systemctl services are running. 
This can be beneficial if you have many embedded devices and want to check if they are functioning properly, without checking each of them separately from the command line interface.
